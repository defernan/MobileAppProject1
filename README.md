8) PRETTY MUCH COMPLETE- Supports iPad and graph gets updated when graph button gets pushed. The partial part is that the toolbar isn't totally finished. The program will run on an iPad and the graphing functionality works. 
9) PARTIAL- Supports rotation on all appropriate devices. Looks good on iPad with exception of calculator shows a little bit in portrait mode. The struts and springs require me to change internal settings, so I didn't mess with them.
